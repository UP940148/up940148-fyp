# Echolocation simulation using Slow-light Radiosity

This repository shows the work done for my Final Year Project at the University of Portsmouth.

This system is a modification of the existing [Slow-light Radiosity repository](https://github.com/portsoc/Slow-light-Radiosity) made by my supervisor [Dr Jacek Kopecky](https://github.com/jacekkopecky) and [Thomas Mattone](https://github.com/Eccsx).

The current version is running at [https://project.d-ellis.net/frontend](https://project.d-ellis.net/frontend).
