# Echolocation simulation using Slow-light Radiosity

## Users gathering feedback

Firstly,\
Thank you for taking the time to consider whether you want to provide feedback on this artefact.

Please ensure you have read and understood the Participant Information Sheet, which can be found [here](./Participant-Information-Sheet.pdf).

The feedback form can be found at [https://forms.gle/1aMj9daFPGgQjFvV9](https://forms.gle/1aMj9daFPGgQjFvV9).

The system is up and running for testing at [https://project.d-ellis.net/frontend](https://project.d-ellis.net/frontend).

Please do investigate features of the system to see how everything works. I'm looking for honest feedback, which includes the mentioning of things that break, or don't work.

The user interface is designed to be fairly self-explanatory, although I have included a basic help page [here](https://project.d-ellis.net/frontend/help.html).

Many thanks,\
Daniel Ellis
